# Onboarding zot for Development

> :point_right: zot is a production-ready, open-source, extensible OCI-native image registry, built for developers by developers.

## Getting Started

<a name='supported-platforms-zot'></a>

### Supported Developer Platforms

Development is officially supported on `Linux` and `Apple MacOS`
platforms. However, development should be possible on any platform that
supports the `golang` toolchain.

| OS     | ARCH  | Platform                            |
|--------|-------|-------------------------------------|
| linux  | amd64 | Intel-based Linux servers           |
| linux  | arm64 | ARM-based servers and Raspberry Pi4 |
| darwin | amd64 | Intel-based MacOS                   |
| darwin | arm64 | ARM-based MacOS (Apple M1)          |

Supported platforms and architectures

### Prerequisites

#### Install golang (1.19+)

The zot project requires `golang 1.19` or newer. You can follow [these instructions](https://go.dev/learn/) to install the `golang` toolchain.
After installation, make sure that the `path` environment variable or
your IDE can find the toolchain.

### Cloning zot

The zot registry code base is hosted on GitHub at
<https://github.com/project-zot/zot>.

To clone the zot project, use this command:

    $ git clone https://github.com/project-zot/zot.git

### Building zot

To build zot, execute the `make` command in the zot directory using the
following general syntax:

`$ make OS=os ARCH=architecture {binary | binary-minimal}`



-   The operating system and architecture options are listed in the
    [Supported platforms and architectures](#supported-platforms-zot)
    table. If an option is not specified, the defaults are `linux` and
    `amd64`.

-   The `binary` option builds the full zot binary image with all
    extensions.

-   The `binary-minimal` option builds the minimal distribution-spec
    conformant zot binary image without extensions, reducing the attack
    surface.



For example, to build a zot image with extensions for an Intel-based
linux server, use the following command:

    make OS=linux ARCH=amd64 binary

The `make` command builds an executable image in the `zot/bin`
directory. The original filename of the zot executable image will
indicate the build options. For example, the filename of an Intel-based
linux minimal image is `zot-linux-amd64-minimal`.

### Running zot

The behavior of zot is controlled via configuration only. To launch the
zot server, execute the following command:

    $  bin/zot-linux-amd64 serve examples/config-example.json

## Debugging zot

To produce a zot binary that includes extensive debugging information,
build zot with the `binary-debug` option, as shown in this example:

    make OS=linux ARCH=amd64 binary-debug

You can then attach and run a debugging tool such as Delve to the
running zot process.

Delve is a powerful open-source debugger for the Go programming
language. Downloads and documentation for Delve are available on GitHub
at <https://github.com/go-delve/delve>.

## Code Organization

The zot project codebase is organized as follows:

## Additional state in zot

In addition to the storage of repository images, zot stores data for various processes in local and remote storage and databases.  The following table shows the storage locations for different processes and types of data.
