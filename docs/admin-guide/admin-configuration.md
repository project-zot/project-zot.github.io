# Configuring zot

> :point_right: The registry administrator configures zot primarily through settings in the configuration file. 

> 
> Using the information in this guide, you can compose a configuration file with the settings and features you require for your zot registry server.
>
> Before launching zot with a new configuration, we recommend that you verify the syntax of your configuration as described in [Verifying the configuration file](#verifying-config).


## Configuration file

The configuration file is a JSON or YAML file that contains all configuration settings for zot functions such as:

-   network
-   storage
-   authentication
-   authorization
-   logging
-   metrics
-   synchronization with other registries
-   clustering

The zot service is initiated with the `zot serve` command followed by the name of a configuration file, as in this example:

`zot serve config.json`

> :pencil2:
> The instructions and examples in this guide use `zot` as the name of the zot executable file. The examples do not include the path to the executable file.

When you first build zot or deploy an image or container from the distribution, a basic configuration file `config.json` is created. This initial file is similar to the following example:

``` json
{
    "distSpecVersion": "1.0.1",
    "storage": {
        "rootDirectory": "/tmp/zot"
    },
    "http": {
        "address": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": "8080"
    },
    "log": {
        "level": "debug"
    }
}
```

The configuration file contains the Distribution Specification version
(`distSpecVersion`). The structure and content of other attributes are
described in the later sections of this guide.


### Extensions

Additional registry features that are not a part of the Distribution Specification are allowed to be added as [Extensions](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/tree/main/extensions).  

With a full (not minimal) zot image, the additional extension features can be enabled and configured under an `extensions` attribute in the configuration file as shown in the following example.

``` json
{
  ...
  "extensions": {
    "metrics": {},
    "sync": {},
    "search": {},
    "scrub": {},
    "lint": {}
  }
}
```

> :warning:
> The extension features are available only with a full zot image. With a minimal zot image, the `extensions` section is ignored if present.


The following features are configured under the `extensions` attribute.

-   [Metrics](#monitor_config)
-   [Sync](#sync_config)
-   [Search](#search_config)
-   [Scrub](#scrub_config)
-   [Lint](#lint_config)

An extension feature is enabled by the presence of the feature’s
attribute under `extensions`. An extension feature can be disabled by
omitting the feature attribute or by including an `enable` attribute
with a value of `false`.

For example, the scrub feature is enabled in the following cases.

``` json
"extensions": {
  "scrub": {}
}
```

``` json
"extensions": {
  "scrub": {
    "enable": true
  }
}
```

The scrub feature is disabled in the following cases.

``` json
"extensions": {
}
```

``` json
"extensions": {
  "scrub": {
    "enable": false
  }
}
```

> :pencil2:
> New functionality can be added to the zot registry by developing custom extensions for integration into zot. For information about developing extensions, see [_Developing New Extensions_](../developer-guide/extensions-dev.md).

<a name="network_config"></a>

## Network configuration

Use the `http` attribute in the configuration file to configure the
zot network settings, as shown in the following example.

``` json
"http": {
  "address":"127.0.0.1",
  "port":"8080",
  "realm":"zot",
  "tls": {
    "cert":"test/data/server.cert",
    "key":"test/data/server.key"
  }
}
```

The following table lists the configurable attributes.

| Attribute | Description                                                                                                 |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `address` | The IP address of the zot server.                                                                |
| `port`    | The port number of the zot server.                                                               |
| `realm`   | The security policy domain defined for the server.                                                          |
| `tls`     | The included attributes in this section specify the Transport Layer Security (TLS) settings for the server. |
| `cert`    | The path and filename of the server’s SSL/TLS certificate.                                                  |
| `key`     | The path and filename of the server’s registry key.                                                         |


<a name="storage_config"></a>

## Storage configuration

### Storage options

With zot, you have the option to store your registry image
files either in local filesystem storage or in cloud storage, such as an
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket.

### Configuring local storage

Local filesystem storage for zot is configured with the
`storage` attribute in the configuration file, as shown in the following
example.

``` json
"storage":{
  "rootDirectory":"/tmp/zot",
  "commit": true,
  "dedupe": true,
  "gc": true,
  "gcDelay": "1h",
  "gcInterval": "24h"
}
```

The following table lists the configurable attributes.

### Configuring S3 storage

Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) for zot can be configured
with the `storageDriver` attribute in the configuration file, as shown
in the following example:

``` json
"storageDriver": {
    "name": "s3",
    "region": "us-east-2",
    "bucket": "zot-storage",
    "secure": true,
    "skipverify": false,
    "accesskey": "<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>",
    "secretkey": "<YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>"
}
```

As in the case with local filesystem storage, you can use multiple
storage locations using the `subpath` attribute, as in the following
example.

``` json
"subPaths": {
    "/a": {
        "rootDirectory": "/zot-a",
        "storageDriver": {
            "name": "s3",
            "region": "us-east-2",
            "bucket": "zot-storage",
            "secure": true,
            "skipverify": false
        }
    },
    "/b": {

...

    }
}
```

The `subPaths` feature ties together several separate storage filesystems and backends behind the same HTTP API interface. In the example above, both repository paths "/a" and "/b" are exposed to clients. Content on these two paths can be hosted completely separately by different storage services, locations, or filesystems, with no difference to the user interface and no perceptible difference to the user experience. This is useful if one wants to serve existing OCI images from different backends or if storage can be expanded only by using different backing stores.

#### S3 Credentials

In the first configuration file example, the S3 credentials were
configured with the attributes `accesskey` and `secretkey.` As an
alternative, you can omit these attributes from the configuration file
and you can configure them using environment variables or a credential
file.

-   Environment variables

    zot looks for credentials in the following environment
    variables:

        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
        AWS_SESSION_TOKEN (optional)

-   Credential file

    A credential file is a plaintext file that contains your access
    keys, as shown in the following example.

        [default]
        aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_DEFAULT_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
        aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_DEFAULT_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>

        [test-account]
        aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_TEST_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
        aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_TEST_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>

        [prod-account]
        ; work profile
        aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_PROD_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
        aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_PROD_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>

    The `[default]` heading defines credentials for the default profile,
    which zot will use unless you configure it to use another
    profile. You can specify a profile using the `AWS_PROFILE`
    environment variable as in this example:

        AWS_PROFILE=test-account

    The credential file must be named `credentials.` The file must be
    located in the `.aws/` folder in the home directory of the same
    server that is running your zot application.

For more details about specifying S3 credentials, see the [AWS
documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html#specifying-credentials).

## Security and hardening

### Authentication

zot supports authentication by the following methods:

-   TLS mutual authentication

-   Basic local authentication using an htpasswd file

-   LDAP authentication

-   Bearer (OAuth2) authentication using an HTTP Bearer token

For detailed information about configuring authentication for your zot
registry, see [User Authentication and Authorization with zot](../articles/authn-authz.md).

### Identity-based authorization

User identity can be used as an authorization criterion for allowing
actions on one or more repository paths. For specific users, you can
choose to allow any combination of read, create, update, or delete
actions on specific repository paths.

For detailed information about configuring access control policies for
your zot registry, see [User Authentication and Authorization with
zot](../articles/authn-authz.md).

### Preventing automated attacks with failure delay

Use the `auth` and `failDelay` attributes under `http` in the
configuration file to delay the response to an authentication failure. A
delayed response helps to prevent automated attacks. The configuration
is shown in the following example.

``` json
"http": {
  "auth": {
    "failDelay": 5
  }
}
```

The `failDelay` attribute specifies a waiting time, in seconds, before
zot sends a failure notification to an authenticating user
who has been denied access.

### Rate limiting

You can limit the rate of API calls from users by configuring the
`Ratelimit` attribute in the configuration file, as shown in the
following example:

``` json
"http": {
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": "8080",
    "Ratelimit": {
        "Rate": 10,
        "Methods": [
            {
                "Method": "GET",
                "Rate": 5
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Rate` attribute directly under `Ratelimit` sets a
global rate limit of ten API calls per second. You can optionally
override the global limit for specific API `Methods`. In this example,
API `GET` calls are limited to five per second.

### Additional security features

For detailed information about configuring additional security features for your zot registry, see [Security Posture](../articles/security-posture.md).


<a name="monitor_config"></a>

## Monitoring

zot supports a range of monitoring tools including the following:

* Logging

    Logging for zot operations is configured with the `log` attribute in the configuration file.

*  Metrics

   Metrics data is available in a Prometheus format. A full zot image with extensions includes a node exporter. A minimal zot image can use an external node exporter such as `zxp`.

* Benchmarking

  The zot project includes the `zb` tool, which allows you to benchmark a zot registry or any other container image registry that conforms to the [OCI Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec).

When zot is deployed in a Kubernetes setup, a site reliability engineering (SRE) operator can monitor service level indicators (SLI) such as metrics and logs. Metrics will appear in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/query-log/) using the zot `metrics` extension, while logs will appear in the Elasticsearch stack ([ELK stack](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack)) using [Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/beats/filebeat).

For detailed information about the monitoring tools, see [Monitoring the registry](../articles/monitoring.md).

For detailed information about benchmarking, see [Benchmarking zot with zb](../articles/benchmarking-with-zb.md).

<a name="cluster_config"></a>

## Clustering zot

To ensure high-availability of the registry, zot supports a clustering scheme with stateless zot instances/replicas fronted by a loadbalancer and a shared remote backend storage. This scheme allows the registry service to remain available even if a few replicas fail or become unavailable. Loadbalancing across many zot replicas can also increase aggregate network throughput.

For detailed information about clustering with zot, see [zot Clustering](../articles/clustering.md).


<a name="sync_config"></a>

## Syncing and mirroring registries

A zot registry can mirror one or more upstream OCI registries, including popular cloud registries such as [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and [Google Container Registry](gcr.io).  If an upstream registry is OCI distribution-spec conformant for pulling images, you can use zot's `sync` extension feature to implement a downstream mirror, synchronizing OCI images and corresponding artifacts. Synchronization between registries can be implemented by periodic polling of the upstream registry or synchronization can occur on demand, when a user pulls an image from the downstream registry.

As with git, wherein every clone is a full repository, you can configure a local zot instance to be a full OCI mirror registry. This allows for a fully distributed disconnected container image build pipeline.

For detailed information about syncing and mirroring, see [OCI Registry Mirroring With zot](../articles/mirroring.md).


<a name="lint_config"></a>

## Linting uploaded images

The lint extension can check an uploaded image to enforce the presence of required annotations such as the author or the license.

To configure linting, add the `lint` attribute under `extensions` in the configuration file, as shown in the following example:

```json
"extensions": {
    "lint": {
      "enable": true,
      "mandatoryAnnotations": ["annot1", "annot2", "annot3"]
      }
  }
```

The following table lists the configurable attributes of the `lint` extension.

| Attribute  |Description  |
|------------|-------------|
| `enable`               | If this attribute is missing, incoming image linting is disabled by default. Linting can be enabled by including this attribute and setting it to `true`. |
| `mandatoryAnnotations` | A list of annotations that are required to be present in the image being pushed to the repository.  |

If the mandatory annotations option is configured when you push an image, linter will verify that the mandatory annotations list present in the configuration is also found in the manifest's annotations list. If any annotations are missing, the push is denied.


<a name="scrub_config"></a>

## Scrubbing the image registry

To check the integrity of the filesystem and the data in the registry, you can schedule a periodic scrub operation. The scrub process traverses the filesystem, verifying that all data blocks are readable. While running, the process may slightly reduce the registry performance.

To enable scrubbing, add the `scrub` attribute under `extensions` in the configuration file, as shown in the following example:

``` json
"extensions": {
  "scrub": {
    "enable": true,
    "interval": "24h"
  }
}
```

The following table lists the configurable attributes for scrubbing the registry.

| Attribute  | Description                                                                                                                             |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `enable`   | If this attribute is missing, registry scrubbing is enabled by default. Scrubbing can be disabled by setting this attribute to `false`. |
| `interval` | The time interval between periodic scrub operations. This value must be at least two hours (`2h`).                                      |


<a name="search_config"></a>

## Enhanced searching and querying images

While basic searching is always enabled for images in the zot registry, you can enable enhanced registry searching and filtering using graphQL.

Add the `search` attribute under `extensions` in the configuration file to enable and configure the enhanced search extension, as shown in the following example.

``` json
"extensions": {
    "search": {
        "enable": true,
        "cve": {
            "updateInterval": "2h"
        }
    }
}
```

The following table lists the configurable attributes for enhanced search.

| Attribute        | Description                                                                                                                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `enable`         | If this attribute is missing, enhanced search is enabled by default. Enhanced search can be disabled by setting this attribute to `false`. |
| `cve`            | Extends enhanced search to allow searching of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE).                                                  |
| `updateInterval` | Sets the interval at which the searchable database of CVE items is refreshed.                                                              |


<a name="verifying-config"></a>

## Verifying the configuration file

Before launching zot, verify the syntax of your configuration
file using the following command:

`zot verify <configfile>`

> :pencil2:
> Verifying the configuration file protects against operator errors and any conflicts arising from zot release version changes.


After verifying your configuration file, you can launch zot with the following command:

`zot serve <configfile>`
