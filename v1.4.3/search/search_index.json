CNCF As part of the Linux Foundation, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation provides support, oversight, and direction for open-source, cloud native projects.   cosign <code>cosign</code> is a tool that performs container signing, verification, and storage in an OCI registry.   cosigned <code>cosigned</code> is an image admission controller that validates container images before deploying them.   cri-o <code>cri-o</code> is an implementation of the Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI) to enable using OCI compatible runtimes. It is a lightweight alternative to using Docker as the runtime for Kubernetes.   deduplication A storage space saving feature wherein only a single copy of specific content is maintained on disk while many different image manifests may hold references to that same content.   digest A hashed checksum, such as SHA-256, for verifying the integrity of the downloaded image.   Distribution Specification The OCI Distribution Specification project defines an API protocol to facilitate and standardize the distribution of content.   extensions Additional registry features (APIs) that are not a part of the Distribution Specification can be added as Extensions.   helm chart A helm chart is a package of files that orchestrate the deployment of Kubernetes resources into a Kubernetes cluster.   manifest An image manifest provides a configuration and set of layers for a single container image for a specific architecture and operating system.   node exporter A software component that collects hardware and operating system level metrics exposed by the kernel.   OCI The Open Container Initiative (OCI) is an open governance structure for the express purpose of creating open industry standards around container formats and runtimes.   ORAS OCI Registry as Storage (ORAS) is a tool for distributing OCI artifacts across OCI registries.   prometheus Prometheus is a node exporter that exposes a wide variety of hardware- and kernel-related metrics.   registry A service that stores and distributes container images and artifacts.   repository A collection of images with the same name, differentiated by tags.   skopeo <code>skopeo</code> is a command line utility that performs various operations on container images and image repositories.   stacker <code>stacker</code> is a standalone tool for building OCI images via a declarative <code>yaml</code> format.
